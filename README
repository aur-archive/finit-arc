Finit is a reimplementation of the Eeepc "fastinit" program based on its
system calls with gaps filled with frog DNA.

Finit's purpose is to build upon the general workings of fastinit and
improve/optimize it for Xandros or alternative distributions running on
the Eeepc. Finit comes in three flavors: finit is a replica of the Asus
fastinit, finit-mod is an improved drop-in replacement for fastinit,
and finit-alt is a generic replacement for other systems. Finit-mod
and finit-alt were much improved with patches from Metalshark.

Usage scenarios
---------------

1. Replace the original Eeepc 702 fastinit (finit-mod)

2. Allow fast booting in alternative Linux distributions running on the
   Eeepc and other netbooks (finit-alt)


Finit-alt is distribution-specific. Currently it generates a finit-mdv
executable for Mandriva 2008/2008.1 systems. Smurfy ported it to
eeeXubuntu, and parts of his port have been merged to finit-alt.


Finit-alt features
------------------

Finit-alt reads configuration information from /etc/finit.conf. See
the source code for available options.


Rebooting and halting
---------------------

Finit handles SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 for reboot and halt, and listens to
/dev/initctl so standard Linux reboot and halt commands should also
work.


Debugging
---------

Add finit_debug to the kernel parameter line to enable trace messages
and to run a shell after the X server.
